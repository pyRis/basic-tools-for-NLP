You've learned the basics of Python/programming, now what? 
- Pep8 coding standards
- - https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/

- Learn about several IDEs/Anaconda(Jupyter Notebooks)

- Learn about several important topics:
- - web scraping (beautiful soup 4)
- - ML (pytorch/tensorflow(????)/scikit learn/lightGBM)
- - math (numpy/scipy)
- - data analysis (pandas)
- - plotting (matplotlib/seaborn)
- - NLP (NLTK/genism/spacy)

What each topic would cover?
- going over basics of the package
- how to read documentation
- how to test these methods/utilize them without assistance
- do a few test examples
- prepare a small assignment based on this
- maybe eventually combine the packages together or have it compile into a final project??

Questionable idea?
- have people scrape a small dataset
- clean and analyze the dataset
- create visualizations of the dataset
- do some minor machine learning process on *that* dataset or a larger one (most likely an existing one though for size reasons)
- create report with latex/overleaf using the template that they made
